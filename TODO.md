# TODO

- [x] Update `index.html` to remove legacy mobile markup and load the unified shell.
- [x] Refactor `src/main.js` to detect mobile, call `injectMobileUI()`, and re-bind DOM references.
- [x] Delete obsolete mobile entry files under `apps/mobile` once migration completes.
- [x] Adjust `netlify.toml` rewrites after removing the dedicated mobile path.
